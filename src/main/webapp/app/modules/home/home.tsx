                    <strong>Race</strong>
                    <br />
                    Racial discrimination means being treated unfairly because you are:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="custom">
                    <li>White;</li>
                    <li>Black or African American;</li>
                    <li>Asian;</li>
                    <li>American Indian or Alaska Native;</li>
                    <li>Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; or</li>
                    <li>a mixture of two or more of these groups.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Racial discrimination also includes being treated unfairly because of personal characteristics associated with race or
                    because you are married to (or associated with) a person of a specific race.
                    <br />
                    Example: A seller refused to sell you their home because you are Black.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Color</strong>
                    <br />
                    Color discrimination means being treated unfairly because of your skin color. While race and color overlap, they are not
                    the same. People of various races and ethnicities may experience discrimination because of their skin color. This type
                    of discrimination may occur within the same race.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Religion</strong>
                    <br />
                    Religious discrimination means being treated unfairly because of your religious beliefs. This can include both the
                    practice and non-practice of a religion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Sex</strong>
                    <br />
                    Sex discrimination means being treated unfairly or differently because of your sex. This includes both harassment
                    because of a person’s sex and sexual harassment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>National Origin</strong>
                    <br />
                    National origin discrimination means being treated unfairly because you:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="custom">
                    <li>are from a specific country or part of the world;</li>
                    <li>speak a certain language or have an accent when you speak;</li>

                    <li>appear to be of a certain ethnic background (even if you are not).</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    National origin discrimination may also include being treated unfairly because you are married to (or associated with) a
                    person of a specific national origin.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Familial Status</strong>
                    <br />
                    Familial status discrimination means being treated unfairly because:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="custom">
                    <li>your family includes at least one child under 18 years old;</li>

                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Disability</strong>
                    <br />
                    Disability discrimination means being treated unfairly because you:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="custom">
                    <li>have a physical or mental disability which substantially limits any major life activity;</li>
                    <li>have a record of a physical or mental disability; or</li>
                    <li>are viewed as having a physical or mental disability.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The Fair Housing Act also requires certain new multifamily dwellings to be accessible for persons with
                    disabilities.
                  </p>
